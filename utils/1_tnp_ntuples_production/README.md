# TnP NTuples production

This first step takes as input the partial NTuples produced with flashgg for data and MC and dumps two unified ROOT files called ```outputData.root``` and ```outputMC.root```.
More details on how to run can be found in the documentation of ```create_input_files.py``` itself. 

N.B.: this works as it is only for 2018 NTuples; 2017 and 2016 seem to follow a different naming scheme for the output files of flashgg.
